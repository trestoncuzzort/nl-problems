# nl-problems — programming problems with solutions, five public sources

**24,748 problems, 23,319 of them (94.2%) carrying reference solutions.** Normalised to
one gzipped JSONL per split, one JSON object per line.

Counts and checksums in [`manifest.json`](manifest.json) are measured from these exact
files. Nothing here is copied from upstream documentation.

## Files

| file | records | with solutions | raw | gzipped |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|

| **total** | **24,748** | **23,319 (94.2%)** | **3,850.9 MB** | **962.3 MB** |

The 1,429 problems without solutions are not an oversight: 1,235 are APPS test problems
whose solutions are withheld in the split as shipped, and 194 are CodeContests train
problems that carry none upstream.

## Reading it

Gzip costs nothing at read time — stream it, never decompress to disk:

```python
import gzip, json

with gzip.open("data/codecontests_train.jsonl.gz", "rt") as f:
    for line in f:
        rec = json.loads(line)
        print(rec["name"], len(rec["solutions"]), "solutions")
```

To clone (the data is in Git LFS, since `apps_raw_test.jsonl` alone is 1.29 GB and GitHub
caps single files at 100 MB):

```bash
git lfs install
git clone <repo-url>
git lfs pull          # if data/ files arrive as pointer stubs
```

## Schemas

**CodeContests** (`codecontests_*`) — Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder, HackerEarth, Aizu.

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | str | problem slug |
| `description` | str | problem statement |
| `source` | str | `CODEFORCES` \| `CODECHEF` \| `ATCODER` \| `HACKEREARTH` \| `AIZU` \| `UNKNOWN_SOURCE` |
| `difficulty` | int | raw upstream code, kept for compatibility |
| `difficulty_label` | str | decoded: `EASY`…`HARDEST`, or the contest letter `A`–`V` |
| `cf_rating`, `cf_points` | int, float | `0` where unknown |
| `cf_tags` | list[str] | e.g. `["greedy","math"]` |
| `cf_contest_id`, `cf_index` | int, str | |
| `public_tests` | list[{input,output}] | the samples shown in the statement |
| `private_tests` | list[{input,output}] | **held-out judge tests** |
| `generated_tests` | list[{input,output}] | **generated judge tests** — the bulk of the test data |
| `solutions` | list[{language,solution}] | correct, **capped at 25** — see below |
| `incorrect_solutions` | list[{language,solution}] | **wrong** submissions, capped at 25 |
| `time_limit_seconds`, `time_limit_nanos`, `memory_limit_bytes` | int | |
| `input_file`, `output_file` | str | usually empty (stdin/stdout) |
| `is_description_translated`, `untranslated_description` | bool, str | |

`language` is one of `PYTHON3`, `PYTHON`, `CPP`, `JAVA`, `UNKNOWN_LANGUAGE` — decoded to
strings here, not the raw ClassLabel integers.

`incorrect_solutions` is worth calling out: these are human-written *wrong* answers to
problems whose correct answers sit in the same record. That is a ready-made preference
signal — chosen/rejected pairs grounded in a real judge rather than in a model's opinion.

**APPS** (`apps_raw_*`) — scraped with judge data.

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | int | index within split |
| `question` | str | problem statement |
| `solutions` | str | **JSON-encoded string** holding a list — parse a second time |
| `input_output` | str | **JSON-encoded string** `{"inputs":[…],"outputs":[…]}` |
| `difficulty` | str | `introductory` \| `interview` \| `competition` |
| `url` | str | originating problem page |
| `starter_code` | str | often empty |

Mind the double encoding: `json.loads(rec["input_output"])` is required. CodeContests
does *not* share this quirk — its tests are real nested objects.

**HumanEval** — 164 records, matching the canonical size.

| field | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `task_id` | str | e.g. `HumanEval/0` |
| `prompt` | str | signature + docstring |
| `canonical_solution` | str | body only, not the full function |
| `test` | str | `check(candidate)` harness |
| `entry_point` | str | function to call |

**MBPP** (`mbpp`, `mbpp_test`, `mbpp_validation`, `mbpp_prompt`) — all four upstream
splits of the `full` config.

| field | type |
|---|---|
| `task_id` | int |
| `text` | str |
| `code` | str |
| `test_list` | list[str] |

## The solution cap, and how to lift it

CodeContests upstream holds **4,494,491 correct and 8,715,949 incorrect solutions** —
20.93 GB as JSONL, which does not fit in GitHub LFS. Solutions are 92.3% of that bulk
(`incorrect_solutions` 63.4%, `solutions` 28.9%); all the test data together is 7.5%.

So the cap falls only on solutions. **Every problem, and every test, is here in full** —
all 1,307,729 public, private and generated tests. Solutions are capped at 25 correct and
25 incorrect per problem, preferring `PYTHON3` > `PYTHON` > `CPP` > `JAVA`, which retains
296,828 correct and 272,311 incorrect.

To rebuild the uncapped 20.93 GB version:

```bash
python scripts/rebuild_codecontests_full.py --out ./cc_full
```

It downloads ~7.6 GB of parquet and writes ~20.9 GB of JSONL, with identical field
semantics and ClassLabel decoding. The shipped files are a strict subset: same rows, same
keys, fewer entries in the two solution lists.

## Provenance and licensing — read before redistributing

| source | upstream | licence |
|---|---|---|
| CodeContests | `deepmind/code_contests` | CC-BY-4.0 |
| APPS | `codeparrot/apps` | MIT |
| MBPP | `google-research-datasets/mbpp` | CC-BY-4.0 |
| HumanEval | `openai/openai_humaneval` | MIT |

Licences are as declared on HuggingFace and have **not** been independently reviewed. Note
separately that problem *statements* from Codeforces, AtCoder, CodeChef and Aizu carry the
original judges' copyright, which is not the dataset authors' to relicense. This repository
is private and is a working transfer inside one lab. Check the terms before republishing,
redistributing outside the lab, or shipping any of it in a public model release.

## Known limitations

- **No cross-source deduplication.** APPS and CodeContests are both substantially
  Codeforces-derived and overlap; nothing has been deduplicated against anything else.
- **No decontamination.** These are widely-used benchmarks present in many pretraining
  corpora. Evaluating on `humaneval` or `mbpp_test` after training on the rest is
  contaminated until proven otherwise.
- **Nothing has been executed.** No solution was run against its own tests to confirm it
  passes, and no `incorrect_solution` was run to confirm it fails. Both labels are taken
  on upstream's word.
- **`incorrect_solutions` are not labelled by failure mode** — a wrong answer, a timeout
  and a compile error are not distinguished.

## Integrity

`manifest.json` records per file: record count, and SHA-256 of both the raw `.jsonl` and
the shipped `.jsonl.gz`.

```bash
gunzip -c data/mbpp.jsonl.gz | sha256sum     # compare to raw_sha256
sha256sum data/mbpp.jsonl.gz                 # compare to gz_sha256
```
